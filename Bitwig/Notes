LinVst may have some problems with some plugins and Bitwig.


A fix at the moment is to change some lines in linvst.cpp

find (around line 1068)

    wait(NULL);	        	    
    delete plugin;		

and change it to

  //  wait(NULL);	        	    
    delete plugin;		


Use the quick fix in conjunction with choosing (checking) the plugins to be run Individually in the Bitwig Settings-Plug-ins panel.
